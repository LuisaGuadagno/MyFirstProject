    <h1> This is the H1 tag responsible for returning heading</h1>
    <p>The p tag returns a paragraph and it's quite useful to generate a text of any length</p>
    <p>This is another p tag and it is returned on a new line without any need to add additional elements or tags</p>

    <h2>This is a H1 tag, which gives a clear idea of the hierarchy behind the headings, this is smaller infact</h3>
    <h3>With this H3 tag, I would like to explain the exact structure of an HTML tag </h3>
